# LaunchWithProton
A shell script that can launch executables using Proton

To install your application, do `Launch.sh application.exe` - Doesn't need to be an installer of course, but I digress.

To run your application, modify `ExampleFixedLauncher.sh` to have the correct paths, then you can add it to steam to run the application with the overlay and so on, with the proton prefix. Steam isn't actually needed to launch of course, you can just run it like any other script.
